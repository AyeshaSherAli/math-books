A recopilation of accesible math-related books.

As I see in twitter Paul Hunt and his students Jonathon and Mia create a "contest" to vote for your favourite accesible math book during the events of the Math olympiad in 2018. 

I haven't found a collections of accesible math books as good as the one that is in the contest so I thought it would be a nice idea to collect them all in an "awesome"-styled repo as a start to create a massive recopilation of books.

(Maybe there are other similar pages, but I made this to be usefull for me and someone suggest me to upload it) 

### All the credit belongs to Paul and his students for all their work starting this idea.
