This little project began when I saw in twitter that Paul Hunt and his students Jonathon and Mia created a "contest" to voted for your favourite accesible math book during the events of the Math olympiad in 2018. 

I haven't found a collections of accesible math books as good as the one that is in the contest so I thought it would be a nice idea to collect them all in an "awesome"-styled repo as a start to create a massive recopilation of books.

(Maybe there are other similar pages, but I made this to be usefull for me and someone suggest me to upload it) 

### I would like to direct all credit to Paul and his students for all their work that motivate the start of this idea.
